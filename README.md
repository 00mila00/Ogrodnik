# ogrodnik
This webpage was created mostly by me and my dear college friend Kasia in PHP and JS as study project,
Main purpose was to create app for people interested in plants.

The database needed for this project was created in phpmyadmin where we added some plants with its description and needs

What you can do in this app:
- make your account and log in later
- add plants to your own plants library
- make calendar events for reminders
- search for plants you need (searcher)

See the added screenshots to see how it looks ;)
